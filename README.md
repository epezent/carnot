## About

SFVG is an extension to SFML providing functionality to draw and animate vector graphics shapes. At a glance, SFVG offers:

- Concave and convex shape triangulation
- Shape offsetting, clipping, corner rounding, and holes
- GLSL shader based gradient fills
- CMYK, HSV, and hexcode Color constructors, and X11 named colors
- An advanced and highly flexible animation framework
- Over 35 tweening functions
- Various graphics related math functions and utilities

## Shapes and Graphics

SFVG's shape class is a drop-in replacement for SFML's. It offers all of the original functionality plus several new features. This includes the ability to draw concave shapes, add radii to corners, add holes, offset and clip shapes, and fill shapes with gradients.
