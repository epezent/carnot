 ☐ make properties take variadic number of args
 ☐ inverse color functions
 ☐ outline to Shape
 ✔ animation relative frames @done (18-06-29 23:03)
 ✔ animation pass frames @done (18-06-30 19:01)
 ✔ animation implicit time 0.0 and 1.0 @done (18-06-29 23:04)
 ✔ generalize fill color @done (18-06-29 23:03)
 ☐ delime: Fill is a class, and Fill may be a Property...can these be one thing? extend to Position, Rotation
 ☐ can Properties be functors? pointers to member functions?
 ☐ add remaining shapes
 ✔ clean up Animation headers @done (18-06-30 01:20)
 ☐ bezier curves, svg import (see Github svgpp)
 ✔ frame "change" function for relative @done (18-06-29 23:04)
 ✔ formalize Property...make get and set that return and take value, move absValue to impl @done (18-06-30 01:20)
 ☐ make dll
 ☐ make animation playable on multiple subjects relatively...how?
 ☐ squash bug where framerate goes down and window fails to load (something to do with compile order and global shaders)
 ☐ add function which takes a shape with more points, and returns a version of the less point shape with equal number of points that are optimally place to blend into the other shape

% move over to global transforms
% add pause/stepping feature
